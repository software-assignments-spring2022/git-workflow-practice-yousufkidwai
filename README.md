## ["Maybe There's a Use for Crypto After All"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html?)[^1]
I recently read this article from the New York Times about Helium, a decentralized wireless network for IoT devices. This company really grabbed my attention, because it's weird to think about how a decentralized wireless network might work. But in reality, a peer-to-peer network of Helium hot spots is really a great idea. If the world was perfect, this company wouldn't have even needed to use cryptocurrency tokens to encourage more people to use their hot spots.

In reality, though, intertwining cryptocurrency as an incentive for people to use their product is a genius idea. It provides utility for cryptocurrency, something that people sometimes fail to see in other tokens. I personally believe that projects like these are the future of our world, not profile picture NFTs that have no real utility. I hope to see more of these projects in the future.

[^1]: An interesting article. I like the author's depiction of Helium as something mundanely useful; not a lot of crypto has this image. -Xuelong(Phillip) Jiang
